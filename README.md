## Problem

### Main motivations

##### Software Security

"If I had all the time and resources in the world to build an application, specially focusing on Security, how whould I do it?".

##### Grounding 

I want to reduce the distance between mental and material world. The costs of building apps are incredibly high nowadays.

##### Sharing

I have decided to share all I know and consider relevant on Security. Some of my many points of view in a simplified way.

## Solution

### Main ideas

* Build an application to create applications.

* Create my own standards and resources.
